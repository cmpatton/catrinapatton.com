	<p> Hello! My name is Catrina Patton and I am currently a student at Startup Insitute, an intensive career accelator program, where I'm learning front end development language and also how to think and work in a start-up community. Previously, I was an IT project manager for local government. I am interested in honing skills that we help me to make an even larger contribution to the community by leveraging my tech skills. </p>
